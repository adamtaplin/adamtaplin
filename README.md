- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamtaplin. I'm getting more experienced every day as I learn to build useful code to support the day job in project management consultancy.

- 👀 I’m interested in... all of it. It's new and exciting. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack. Trying to add another string to my bow, after a lot of time spent with Django.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on git. Seriously, I've only ever used it to back up my work, so I need to up my game.

- 📫 How to reach me ...right here!
